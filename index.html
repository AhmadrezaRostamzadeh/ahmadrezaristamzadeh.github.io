						<h3><i>About Me</i></h3>
					</header>
					<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
						
						Hi! I'm Ahmadreza Rostamzadeh, a senior undergraduate student at the Sharif University of Technology. My main research interests 
						are Fluid mechanics and microfluidics and their applications in Lab-on-a-chip platforms, Electrowetting on dielectric and cell separation. <br>
						I like to learn more about microfluidics and microfabrication; therefore,
						I joined the Micro-Nano Systems Lab at Sharif Universi of Technology, 
						and I worked in several fields of microsystems like micro and nanopore fabrication,
						microfluidics chip fabrication and EWOD. Most of my research was in the area of EWOD,
						and as my B.Sc. thesis, I could develop a covered EWOD platform capable of mixing and splitting. 
						Because this field is multi-disciplinary, I got experience in different areas. 
						I want to learn more about microfluidics systems and how they can be used in broader biological and chemical applications. <br>
						Some problems with microfluidics current devices should be resolved to reach this goal. My future goal is to make it possible by
						innovative application of the knowledge I gain from experimenting and studying in different fields like microfabrication and electronics.

							among the mechanical engineering students, during this time I worked on different projects there, such as conventional methods for
							solid-state micropore fabrication and EWOD, after my internship my research focus was in EWOD platform, and as a part of EWOD team,
							we were able to build a covered EWOD platform and we also have tried some innovative ideas to expand the application of this platform.
							One of these Ideas is upside-down EWOD which is going to be used as a platform to manipulate objects.

						<i>Design and Fabrication of a Covered EWOD Device Capable of Splitting and Mixing</i>
					</h4>
					<h5>
						Micro-Nano Systems Lab, Tehran, Iran
					</h5>
					<h6>
						August 2022 - August 2023
					</h6>
					<p>
					This project was my B.Sc. thesis, and our team was supervised by Dr. Mojtaba Taghipour at MNSL.<br>
 
					In this project, our goal was to reach a covered EWOD platform capable of mixing and splitting droplets.
					After testing several materials for dielectric and hydrophobic coatings, we developed the system.
					We went further to get feedback on the position of droplets and implement a GUI for users.
					We also designed an alternating voltage to overcome drawbacks like contact line pinning.
					Alternating voltage helped us to transfer droplets more smoothly.<br>
					We tried to split droplets using different configurations. Finally,
					we could split a droplet by implementing alternating voltage and a small gap between the electrodes and ITO glass.
					We compared different methods of mixing in EWOD. Image processing was used to analyze the mixing time of these methods.

						Optics Lab, Tehran, Iran

					<h6>
						August 2022 - Present
					</h6>
					<p>
						This project is going on under the supervision of Dr. Bijarchi at Optics Lab.<br>
 
						In this project, a ferrodroplet is detached from a surface, and its related parameters
						, like residue and magnetic force, are studied under different actuation conditions. Droplet detachment is 
						filmed using a high-speed camera, and with the knowledge of magnetic field distribution,
						the magnetic force is calculated using image processing.

						<i>Upside-Down Electrowetting on Dielectric</i>
					</h4>
					<h5>
						Micro-Nano Systems Lab, Tehran, Iran
					</h5>
					<h6>
						February 2022 - Present
					</h6>
					<p>
						This project is going on under the supervision of Dr. Taghipour at MNSL.<br>
 
						In this project, we aim to use the EWOD platform to manipulate objects and transfer them to different destinations.
						EWOD uses liquid bridges to pick up the objects, so it makes it possible to manipulate sensitive objects automatically
						, and it can be a cost-effective replacement for robotic arms. In the current stage, we are designing the setup for testing the idea.
						In this setup,EWOD will pick up different objects from a station, and we will evaluate the motion and detachment
						of the droplet and object.
